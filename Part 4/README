# [Part 4] - Plansformer                                                                              

## Overview
The notebooks in this module explain how to fine-tune the CodeT5-base model on planning problems, leading to the creation of Plansformer, and further demonstrate how to use Plansformer for inference.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming.

## How to Run This Notebook
1. **Open in Google Colab**: Click on the link at the top of the notebook to open it in Google Colab.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the first few code cells to install required Python packages and import Plansformer from Dropbox.
3. **Runtime Setup**: Ensure you are using a Python environment with GPU support for better performance. In Google Colab, you can set this via `Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU`.
4. **Run Each Cell**: Execute each cell in sequence by pressing `Shift + Enter`. Read the comments and instructions in each cell to understand the code and outputs.
5. **Experiment**: Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different problems provided in `./data/test_samples`.

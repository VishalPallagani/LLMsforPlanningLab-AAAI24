#  [LQ2] Harnessing Large Language Models for Planning: A Lab on Strategies for Success and Mitigation of Pitfalls

##  Introduction
Welcome to our **interactive lab session** at AAAI, 2024! ðŸŽ‰ The goal of this lab is to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the potential and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of planning, through hands-on application of masked, seq2seq, and causal LLMs for planning problems.

## Lab Schedule

- [ ] Part 1 - **Introduction and Overview**
  - A brief discussion on the relevance of LLMs in planning and the objectives of the lab.

- [ ] Part 2 - **Brief Overview of Symbolic Planners and Plan Validators**
  - Exploring the basics of symbolic planning problems, planning solvers, and plan validators.

- [ ] Part 3 - **Deep-Dive into LLMs**
  - Introduction to various training and architectural paradigms in LLMs.

- [ ] Part 4 - **Overview of LLMs in Planning**
  - Discussing the different applications of using LLMs in planning.

- [ ] Part 5 - **Plansformer**
  - Overview: Introduction to the Plansformer model.
  - Hands-on Session with masked, seq2seq, causal LLMs for plan generation.

- [ ] Part 6 - **Neuro-Symbolic Approaches - SOFAI Architecture**
  - Thinking Fast and Slow in AI (SOFAI) for planning.

- [ ] **Summary and Q/A [15 mins]**
  - Wrapping up the session with a summary and a Q&A session for attendees to engage with the speakers.

# [Part 2] - Brief Overview of Symbolic Planners and Plan Validators                                                                             

## Overview
This module introduces symbolic planning problems, planners, and validators. Participants will acquire the knowledge necessary to invoke a planner and generate a plan for a PDDL planning problem through API calls to planning.domains and Unified Planning. We also show a working example of validating a plan.


## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming.

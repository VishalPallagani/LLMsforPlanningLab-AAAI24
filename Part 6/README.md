# [Part 6] - Neuro-Symbolic Approaches - SOFAI Architecture

While this lab focuses on the interactive exploration of Large Language Models for Planning, we don't provide a direct hands-on experience with the SOFAI for Planning here. 

However, for enthusiasts eager to delve deeper into neuro-symbolic methods and the SOFAI architecture, check out our well-documented repository, which offers an in-depth look at the integration of SOFAI within Planning frameworks.
